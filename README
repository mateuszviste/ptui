PTUI stands for "Portable Terminal UI". It is an ANSI C library that provides
simple terminal-handling routines that can operate on Linux, Windows and DOS.

The prototype declarations (ptui.h) are common to all platforms, but source
files are not - each platform needs to build and link to the proper module:

ptui-curse.c   ncurses-based backend (Linux and Windows, requires libncurses)
ptui-dj.c      DJGPP driver (DOS, protected mode)
ptui-dos.c     real-time DOS driver (uses direct MDA/VGA hardware calls)
